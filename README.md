File Organizer using Pathlib

Project Overview:
This project is a Python-based File Organizer that automatically organizes files into folders based on their file extensions.
It scans a given directory (including its subdirectories), identifies file types, and moves them into appropriate folders such as Images, TextFiles, Videos, and Others.
The project is built using Python’s pathlib module for modern and platform-independent file system handling and includes logging to track file movements.

Features:

- Organizes files based on extension
- Supports subdirectories (recursive scan)
- Automatically creates required folders
- Logs every file movement
- Uses pathlib instead of os for file handling
- Simple and extensible design

Tech Stack:

- Language: Python
- Core Libraries:
- pathlib – file and directory handling
- logging – logging file operations


Concepts Used:

- File system automation
- Recursive directory traversal
- Logging and error handling

Learning Outcomes:

- Learned how to use pathlib for file and directory operations
- Understood recursive file traversal using rglob()
- Implemented file categorization logic
- Used logging for tracking system operations
- Built a real-world file automation tool
